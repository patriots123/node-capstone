# Payment Tracker

  This is the Payment Tracker app. Anyone can come to this app to easily keep track of regularly paid bills. The user first needs an account which is created with an email
  and password. They can then go into their account to view their already created payments, create a new payment to track, delete old or unused payments, and to update the information
  of existing payments.
